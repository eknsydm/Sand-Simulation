# Sand Simulation

A 2D simulation of falling sand using SDL2, written in C. This project allows you to interact with a grid of sand particles, where you can drop sand and watch it move according to gravity in different directions.

## Features

- **Sand Simulation**: Watch sand fall and move in different directions, based on the physics of gravity and user input.
- **Keyboard Controls**: Use keyboard keys to control the sand movement:
  - **A**: to Left
  - **D**: to Right
  - **Space** , **1**: Drop sand
  - **ESC**: Exit the program

- **SDL2 Rendering**: The simulation is rendered using the SDL2 library, offering an interactive visualization.

## Requirements

To compile and run the project, you need:

- C Compiler (GCC recommended)
- SDL2 library (with development headers)
